### Where to find information

- Current code: `main.R` calls our current analysis scripts in the correct order. 
- Current analysis: look for the highest version numbers in the `results` folder. For expert annotation of cel types by Debbie's group, look for the latest date in `accessory_data/annotations`.
- Past code: the source code for this project is controlled using `git`.
- Past analysis: We have a [running log of analysis results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1821Tmh7PI_E_pbWKDu6sCmiiQHPWh6BPsS8Jrm8EKPI/edit?usp=sharing) (google doc). It is mostly irrelevant now that we have a better understanding of what cell types are present, but it could be useful if any issues come up that were previously raised and analyzed. It focuses on QC and the cells-vs-empties cutoff. 
- Environment: this project uses R 4.1.2 with packages managed by renv. One python tool (cellbender) was previously tried, but results were discarded.
